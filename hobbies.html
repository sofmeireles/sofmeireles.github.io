            <p>I’ve been playing cello since I was 10 years old. I studied music in Conservatório Regional de Música de
                Vila Real, until I finish the basic music course (5th grade). After that, I continued my studies in
                ArtMusic - Berço da Cultura da Lixa, until I finished school. Now, I play in the orchestra of TAUC and
                in the Orquestra Académica da Universidade de Coimbra. I also enjoy learning other instruments so I can
                play at least 3 songs on a trombone, bass, ukulele, melodica, piano or flute.</p>

                Related to music but this time from the audience's side, I really like to watch concerts or go to music
                festivals. Being able to see my favorite artists live or to discover a new band is the best!

            <p>Since I was born, I always liked to do sport related activities. I started practicing karate when I was 5
                and got my black belt at 16, as well as some prizes at the national championships. When I moved to
                Coimbra, I had the necessity to find a sport that I could conciliate with my studies, so I found
                orienteering. In the summer, I usually go sailing with my friends from CNAFF.</p>
            <p>In the covid outbreak, when we couldn’t leave the houses, I discovered that competitive yoyo was a thing,
                and even though I never competed, I have learned a lot of cool tricks. If you want to check it out you
                can find some clips on my tiktok @sofmeireles (shameless plug haha)!</p>
