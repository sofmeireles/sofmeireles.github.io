      <p>Hi! I'm Sofia and I'm 22 years old. I grew up in Vila Real and now I'm studying in Coimbra.
        To be honest I don't know what to say about me, so I will try to make a clich√© sentence to try to describe
        myself:</p>
      <p class="cit">"I consider myself determined and motivated to face challenges and persistent enough to not give up
        on my goals.<br>I like to be part of teams to learn what others have to teach me."
      </p>
      <p>
        <br>I made this website because Europass was down so I couldn't do my CV to apply to curricular
        internships/these.<br>
        Unfortunately (or fortunately, I guess that depends on the point of view), I spent too much time on it because I
        wanted to do something nice (or at least have the contents centered or semi-aligned) so I kinda didn't finish on
        time. Anyway, I used it to learn more html/css/js and overall I'm satisfied with the results. I hope you like it
        and if you find bugs or have some suggestions please contact me!
      </p>
